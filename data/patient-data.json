They do not diagnose for any conditions  or determine medical action. Having a certain risk does not mean you will definitely develop the trait or condition. Similarly, you could still develop a trait or  condition even if you do not have a detected mutation, as there may be other genetic mutations not included in this report. Genetics is not a crystal ball—  it alone cannot predict what will or will not be. Factors like lifestyle and environment can also affect whether a person develops a health condition or trait.  The current report cannot tell you about your overall risk for these conditions, and they cannot determine if you will or will not develop a condition. ",

Right from ingesting food, inhaling air, drinking water to response to infections, allergies, reaction to drugs—all are governed by the different biochemical reactions. These reactions happen in perfect tandem and synchrony, for body functions to be carried out harmoniously. An imbalance in one or more may result in diseases in the long run. Imbalance in even one set of biochemical reactions or metabolism may result in several symptoms. For example, inflammation caused due to some foods may trigger issues like skin rashes, joint pain, slow organ function, and so on. Variations in our genes can cause strength or weaknesses in the metabolism and hence slow down or aggravate metabolic activities.
